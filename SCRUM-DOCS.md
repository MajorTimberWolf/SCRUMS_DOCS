# SCRUM DOCS

This is the documentation of the work I have done in the past few months. The SCRUM is divided into two sections of projects and internships, with the repo/proof attached. 




## Projects (Worked on/Currently Working on)
- [SuperImage](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhenxiang.superimage&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1) (Co-Developed with Zhenxiang Chen, UCLA) 

Tech used: Kotlin, DLF and Image Restoration

An Image-Upscaling App deployed on the playstore. I Co-Developed this, working on the MNN Deep-Learning Framework and it's integration with the app for the usage of GPU and Training the Image Upscaling model. I also worked on the partial integration of Real-ESRGAN, which is an algorithm used for Image Upscaling. 

- [Project-Zephyrus](https://github.com/Project-Zephyrus-CAF/device_oneplus_opkona) (Co-Developed with HELLBOY017, TIET)

Tech used: Assembly, Shell, C++ and C

A CAF based ROM for the Oneplus 8 series/9R. I Co-developed this, working on the integrations of Gaaps (Google Apps) with the ROM. I also worked on the kernel of the ROM, to improve performance and reduced latency/buffering and added prop files to include KernelSU integration with the kernel. 

- Q-Sweeper (WIP)
Tech used: Python, Qiskit, Qbits

A revamp of the classic; Minesweeper, but using Quantum Q-bits. It's integration will work with a python module called Qiskit, The game board is composed by a 3 x 3 grid, which is represnted by a 9 qubit pure, but possibly highly entangled, quantum state. I am currently working on the integration of it, hence can't provide more details.

## Internship

- Currently Working at: Google (Remote)

I work at Google Bard, remotely, working with the PaLm Large Language model and teaching the model the concept of 'chain-of-thought prompting'. I work on integration the dataset with the model, to ensure that variations of the same question, are answered with legitimacy and properly.
